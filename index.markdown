I'm dealing with **electrical engineering** and **data science** and has been around in the energy industry for over a decade, specializing in the _whole lifecycle of asset management_, especially in the _reliability_ and _integrity engineering_. Shifted for the greater good to the **green energy industry**.

Involves in the engineering phase of [Ocean Wind 01 project, New Jersey](https://oceanwindone.com/), working on the development of [dynamic line rating technology](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Jul/IRENA_Dynamic_line_rating_2020.pdf?la=en&hash=A8129CE4C516895E7749FD495C32C8B818112D7C).
